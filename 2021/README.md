# OSINT puzzles from Hotelrooms and other strange places

### OSINT & geolocation 2021 quiz

Welcome to the 2021 OSINT quiz: "OSINT puzzles from Hotelrooms and other strange places"!

In this repository you will find a password-protected archive with different OSINT and geolocation quiz tasks.
Follow the white rabbit down the rabbit hole through different sites in different parts of the world and using your OSINT skills try to find all the answers. Remember that the tools arenâ€™t enough. Use your open mind and try not to fall in the mind traps. If you are really stuck, look at the tips. Seeing them before trying your own ideas will spoil you all the fun.

The password to the next step is always the MD5 hash made of the current step's answer written using only small Latin letters (and numbers and spaces if necessary).
For example, if the answer is "The White Rabbit", you have to make an MD5 hash of "the white rabbit" (without quotes), which in this case is 3431c695575ec664aebd5490fc1756b5. Use that hash to unlock the next level and see how deep does the rabbit hole go.
For MD5 hashes, you can use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=MD5()) or [this tool](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/md5.html) or any other one.

Have fun!

To start, just use the hash of the word "rabbit" (without quotes) to uncover the first level task.
