Welcome to the OSINT quiz section!

In the subdirectories of this repository you will find password-protected archives with different OSINT and geolocation quiz tasks.
Follow the white rabbit down the rabbit hole through different sites in different parts of the world and using your OSINT skills try to find all the answers. Remember that the tools arenâ€™t enough. Use your open mind and try not to fall in the mind traps. If you are really stuck, look at the tips. Seeing them before trying your own ideas will spoil you all the fun.

The password to the next step is always the MD5 hash made of the current step's answer written using only small Latin letters (and numbers and spaces if necessary).
For example, if the answer is "The White Rabbit", you have to make an MD5 hash of "the white rabbit" (without quotes), which in this case is 3431c695575ec664aebd5490fc1756b5. Use that hash to unlock the next level and see how deep does the rabbit hole go.
For MD5 hashes, you can use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=MD5()) or [this tool](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/md5.html) or any other one.

Have fun!
